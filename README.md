# PHP Implicit Type Conversion Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in PHP related to implicit type conversion and loose comparison when dealing with object properties.  The bug occurs when an object property intended to be numeric is instead represented as a string, leading to unexpected results due to PHP's loose comparison operator (`==`).

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` offers a solution to avoid this issue.

## Bug Description
The main issue lies in how PHP handles comparisons between numbers and strings. When comparing using `==` (loose comparison), PHP will often attempt to implicitly convert the types to make the comparison possible. While seemingly convenient, this can mask errors and lead to unpredictable outcomes.

## How to Reproduce
Run `bug.php`.  Observe the unexpected result.  This highlights the problem of relying on loose comparison when dealing with numeric object properties that might be strings.

## Solution
Use the strict comparison operator (`===`) to ensure that the type and value are both matched. This eliminates the risk of implicit type juggling leading to incorrect comparisons.  See `bugSolution.php` for the corrected code.
