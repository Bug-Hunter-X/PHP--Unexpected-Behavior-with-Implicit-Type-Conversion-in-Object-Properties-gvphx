In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object properties, specifically when relying on implicit type conversions and loose comparisons. Consider a scenario where you expect a specific property to be a numeric value. Let's say you have an object with a 'count' property, which you expect to be an integer.  If 'count' is unintentionally set to a string representation of a number (e.g., "5" instead of 5), this can lead to unexpected behavior. This is because PHP's loose comparison (==) might evaluate as true even if the types don't strictly match.
